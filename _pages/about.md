I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://stat.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a> at the <a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank">University of Missouri</a>. I develop provable statistical and machine learning methods that are used to solve quantitative scientific problems in social science and engineering. I specialize in solving computational challenges due to resource constraints and robust inference for regression problems.
