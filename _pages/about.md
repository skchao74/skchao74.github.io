I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://stat.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a> at the <a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank">University of Missouri</a>. I develop provable statistical and machine learning methods that are used to solve quantitative scientific problems in social science and engineering. I specialize in solving computational challenges due to resource constraints and robust inference for (robust) regression problems, with applications to deep learning, causal inference, medical imaging and more.

I organized a virtual session in <a href="https://symposium2021.icsa.org" target="_blank"> ICSA 2021</a> between 2--3:40 PM ET on September 14, 2021.
We were fortunate to have three excellent speakers: Dr. Arun Kumar (CMU), Dr. Lucy Gau (University of Waterloo) and Dr. Samuel Davenport (UCSD), who will speak on latest development of selective inference. Recording will be available soon for registered participants. -->
